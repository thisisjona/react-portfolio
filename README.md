# <React Portfolio>

## Description

A showcase of projects worked on during the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp though React

- React is a modern, in-demand technology developed by Facebook and widely used by some of the most prolific websites today.
- Developing a portfolio using this technology will display my knowledge of the paradigm and will show prospective employers a glimpse of past projects
=
- I've learned how a single-page application can be very dymanic and actually quite fun to work with.
